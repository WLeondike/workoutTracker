# Workout Tracker

  ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)

  Inside this application, the user will be able to view, create, and track daily workouts. The user will also be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. The user is also able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, the user should be able to track the distance traveled.
